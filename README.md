### Hi there üëã, I am [Nophi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nophi-biton/).
I am a civil engineer that is passionate in expanding my expertise in the field of structural reliability and optimization. I am also very interested in applying AI and machine learning into different structural engineering problems.


üå± I‚Äôm currently learning [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info) and [Mathematics for machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/home/info). 

üëÄ Check out my notes and scripts about:
