### Hi there 👋, I am [Nophi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nophi-biton/).
I am a civil engineer that is passionate in expanding my expertise in the field of structural reliability and optimization. I am also very interested in applying AI and machine learning into different structural engineering problems.


🌱 I’m currently learning [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info) and [Mathematics for machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/home/info). 

👀 Check out my notes and scripts about:
- [Reliability-based Design Optimization](https://github.com/nophibiton/RBDO-Matlab-Double-Loop.git)
- [System Reliability bounds using Linear Programming](https://github.com/nophibiton/system-reliability-using-LP)

📝 You can check my previous scientific work on:
- [A heuristic optimization considering probabilistic constraints via an equivalent single variable Pearson distribution system](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2019.03.021)
- [A heuristic moment-based framework for optimization design under uncertainty](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00366-019-00759-4)
